##  Hi, I'm Roman

Welcome to my GitHub page.

I’m a quantitative researcher 📊 currently completing my PhD (Dr. rer. pol.) at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany. My work combines applied econometrics, causal inference and natural language processing 🤖 to extract meaningful insights from complex and often unstructured datasets. I am currently especially interested on labor market dynamics 💼, online job vacancy data, and structural transformation 🌱. 

I enjoy developing projects from start to finish, covering everything from data collection and cleaning to empirical analysis and effective communication of results.

🛠️ Tools & Approach

For coding, I primarily work with Stata and Python, applying panel data models, instrumental variable strategies, and high-dimensional fixed effects. In Python, I regularly use libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib/seaborn for data processing and visualization. I also work with scikit-learn and NLTK and I am particularly interested in further deepening my expertise in machine learning workflows and natural language processing.

Reproducibility, structured research design, and transparent data pipelines are central elements of my workflow.
